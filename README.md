I created this project using Laravel (php framework) with vue.
Laravel MVC for better code management and vue for SPA front end design.

- configure .env file to match your database credentials
- create database with "weatherapp" as name
- run the migration and execute the provided .sql file to populate the cities table (cities.sql)
